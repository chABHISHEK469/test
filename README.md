Here is the code for the classic "Hello World" program in Go: ``` package main import "fmt" func main() { fmt.Println("Hello, World!") } ``` Let's break it down: - `package main`: This program is in the `main` package, which is the default package for executable Go programs. - `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O. - `func main() { ... }`: Every executable Go program must have a `main` function, which is the entry point for the program. - `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`: This line calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package, which prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console with a line break at the end. When you run this program, it will output the following to the console: ``` Hello, World! ```
